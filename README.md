# Error COntrol in Relay Network

The project deals with the study of multi-hop relay
network architecture that has been introduced in the next
generation wireless cellular networks such as LTE advanced and
WiMax systems as a promising technique to improve the coverage
and the throughput of the network. The report illustrates both
theoretical as well as analytic study of performance of different
error control schemes for relay networks.
